???
- Your notes here

---
# What is a base image?

- A root filesystem

- Or a template for one

- eg: Docker, Kubernetes and LXC all will use base image templates

???
- Pretty much all operating systems have a root filesystem
- It is the one place that the system expects to exist so it can boot up
- All other kinds of Thin VMs - Containers - are no different
- The same for Thick VMs - Full System emulators - they have this root
filesystem packed into their disk image

--
- Not used for "single binary image" containers

???
- There are some container building efforts that build "single binary images"
    - This talk is not touching on those

--

<br>

# Where do *your* base images come from?

- Provided by your Operating System

- Downloaded by your framework

--
- "Steve", around the back of the pub?

---
# Why build your own?

- The three "R"s:
    - Repeatable
    - Reliable
    - Reproducible

- Customise the default config to match your needs

- Include special packages (private builds or specific versions)

- Use one build that can be used for Testing, QA, CI and Production

- Building for new architectures or hardware platforms

???
- If you are using services provided by others, it is often important to have
both trust in them and a plan for when they stop
- Building your own image gives you the ability to prove that you can control
your software and work independantly of external changes.
- It can also be important if you are incorporating your own local software
as that software will not be part of any third party image
- Finally, it is sometimes required if you are building for a new machine or
architecture that nobody else supports.

# What options do I have?


- debootstrap
    - Used by the debian installer, implements all the package installation
    internally, so only needs shell, wget and binutils to run

- cdebootstrap
    - A "C implementation of debootstrap", with the same features

- multistrap
    - Uses the normal debian apt and dpkg tools.  Supports installing the
    base system with packages from multiple repositories

- vmdebootstrap
    - Wrapper around debootstrap for building a virtual disk image for VMs

- Many more!

???
- debootstrap can be used to install Debian from a completely different OS,
without installing anything other than the debootstrap shell script
- I'm only going to look at two: debootstrap and multistrap
    - debootstrap is the lowest common denominator
    - multistrap is useful for foreign architecture or multi-repository cases

---
# debootstrap

<br>
<pre class="example">
sudo debootstrap --arch=amd64 \
    SUITE \
    TARGETDIR \
    MIRROR
</pre>

???
- Foreign architecture needs a second stage (--foreign and --second-stage)
- It is possible to avoid root for much of the build, but that has its own
complications (fakeroot permissions preservation, foreign arch emu)

---
# debootstrap

<div class="exampleref">
    (See also the [example1](example1) files in the repo)
</div>
<pre class="example">
sudo debootstrap --arch=amd64 \
    stretch \
    /var/lib/container/example1 \
    http://httpredir.debian.org/debian
</pre>

???
- This will take some time
- There are ways to cache the downloads and speed it up
- The codenames for both debian and ubuntu are valid here, however a newer
debootstrap might sometimes be needed (or a workaround)
- Ubuntu would obviously have a different archive URL

---
# multistrap

<pre class="example">
sudo /usr/sbin/multistrap --arch amd64 \
    -f multistrap.conf \
    -d TARGETDIR
</pre>

???
- stateless - can pickup where it left off
- Harder to avoid running as root (fakeroot doesnt work as well here)
- needs a postinstall script to properly complete installation
- policy.d to avoid packages starting (multistrap runs the "real" package
post install scripts
- Foreign architecture is still fun

--
<br><br>
*NOTE:* it needs a config file!

---
# multistrap

Config file ([multistrap.conf](example2/multistrap.conf))
<pre class="example">
[General]
bootstrap=Stretch
aptsources=Stretch

[Stretch]
source=http://httpredir.debian.org/debian
suite=stretch
keyring=debian-archive-keyring
packages= systemd udev kmod apt
</pre>

???
- Some lines left out for berevity - see the example2 folder in the repo for
a complete set

---
# multistrap

<div class="exampleref">
    (See also the [example2](example2) files in the repo)
</div>
Install stage:
<pre class="example">
sudo /usr/sbin/multistrap --arch amd64 \
    -f multistrap.conf \
    -d /var/lib/container/example2
</pre>
<br>
Configure stage: (sometimes optional)
<pre class="example">
chroot /var/lib/container/example2 dpkg --configure -a
</pre>

???
- Installation does everything it can, up until it needs to run the install
scripts
- Configure is needed for foreign architectures, or more complex native ones
- For clarity, the configure step has been significantly shortened.  See the
example files (or just read the multistrap man page) for more details
