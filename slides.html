- Your notes here

---
# What is a base image?

- root filesystem

- template

???
- Pretty much all operating systems have a root filesystem
- It is the one place that the system expects to exist so it can boot up
- Virtual Machines and Containers are no different

--
- not for "a single binary image"

???
- There are some container building efforts that build "single binary images"
- I'm not talking about those today

--

<br>

# Where do *your* base images come from?

- Provided by your Operating System

- Downloaded by your Framework

--
- "Steve", around the back of the pub?

---
# Builders

---
# debootstrap

---
# multistrap

---
# Comparison

- pros and cons of both tools

---
# Output

- what you can use it for straight away

---
# Improvements

- fixup
- minimise
- customise

---
# Simple boot

---
# Other ways to boot

- chroot
- nspawn
- libvirt
