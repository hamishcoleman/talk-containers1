???
- Your notes here

---
# What is a base image?

- A root filesystem

- Or a template for one

- eg: Docker, Kubernetes and LXC all will use base image templates

???
- Pretty much all operating systems have a root filesystem
- It is the one place that the system expects to exist so it can boot up
- All other kinds of Thin VMs - Containers - are no different
- The same for Thick VMs - Full System emulators - they have this root
filesystem packed into their disk image

--
- Not used for "single binary image" containers

???
- There are some container building efforts that build "single binary images"
    - This talk is not touching on those

--

<br>

# Where do *your* base images come from?

- Provided by your Operating System

- Downloaded by your framework

--
- "Steve", around the back of the pub?

---
# Why build your own?

- The three "R"s:
    - Repeatable
    - Reliable
    - Reproducible

- Customise the default config to match your needs

- Include special packages (private builds or specific versions)

- Use one build that can be used for Testing, QA, CI and Production

- Building for new architectures or hardware platforms

???
- If you are using services provided by others, it is often important to have
both trust in them and a plan for when they stop
- Building your own image gives you the ability to prove that you can control
your software and work independantly of external changes.
- It can also be important if you are incorporating your own local software
as that software will not be part of any third party image
- Finally, it is sometimes required if you are building for a new machine or
architecture that nobody else supports.

---
# What options do I have?


- debootstrap
    - Used by the Ubuntu and Debian installers, implements all the
    package installation internally, so only needs shell, wget and
    binutils to run

- cdebootstrap
    - A "C implementation of debootstrap", with the same features

- multistrap
    - Uses the normal debian apt and dpkg tools.  Supports installing the
    base system with packages from multiple repositories

- vmdebootstrap
    - Wrapper around debootstrap for building a virtual disk image for VMs

- Many more!

???
- debootstrap can be used to install Debian from a completely different OS,
without installing anything other than the debootstrap shell script
- These four are all easily installable from the Debian and Ubuntu package
repositories
- There are other packaged options, and even more that are just someones
project
- I will go into more detail about two of these:
    - debootstrap since it is the lowest common denominator
    - multistrap because it is is useful for foreign architecture or
    multi-repository cases

---
# debootstrap

<p style="line-height: 99%;"><br></p>
<pre class="example">
sudo debootstrap --arch=amd64 \
    SUITE \
    TARGETDIR \
    MIRROR
</pre>

???
- Foreign architecture needs a second stage (--foreign and --second-stage)
- It is possible to avoid requiring root for much of the build, but that
has its own complications (fakeroot permissions preservation, foreign arch emu)

--

SUITE is one of the Debian/Ubuntu release code names:
- jessie, trusty, stretch, xenial, bionic, buster, etc

MIRROR is the package repository URL:
- http://httpredir.debian.org/debian
- http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu

---
# debootstrap

<div class="exampleref">
    (See also the [example1](example1) files in the repo)
</div>
<pre class="example">
sudo debootstrap --arch=amd64 \
    stretch \
    /var/lib/container-example/example1 \
    http://httpredir.debian.org/debian
</pre>

???
- This will take some time
- There are ways to cache the downloads and speed it up
- The codenames for both debian and ubuntu are valid here, however a newer
debootstrap might sometimes be needed (or a workaround)
- Ubuntu would obviously have a different archive URL

---
# multistrap

<pre class="example">
sudo /usr/sbin/multistrap --arch amd64 \
    -f multistrap.conf \
    -d TARGETDIR
</pre>

???
- stateless - can pickup where it left off
- Harder to avoid running as root (fakeroot doesnt work as well here)
- needs a postinstall script to properly complete installation
- policy.d to avoid packages starting (multistrap runs the "real" package
post install scripts
- Foreign architecture is still fun

--
<br><br>
*NOTE:* it needs a config file!

---
# multistrap

Config file ([multistrap.conf](example2/multistrap.conf))
<pre class="example">
[General]
bootstrap=NameOfSectionDefiningRepo
aptsources=NameOfSectionDefiningRepo

[NameOfSectionDefiningRepo]
source=MIRROR
suite=SUITE
keyring=debian-archive-keyring ubuntu-archive-keyring
packages= systemd udev kmod apt
</pre>

???
- Some lines left out for berevity - see the example2 folder in the repo for
a complete set
- keyring defines a package name that needs to be installed on the host build
system to allow the correct authentication of packages installed in the target

---
# multistrap

<div class="exampleref">
    (See also the [example2](example2) files in the repo)
</div>
Install stage:
<pre class="example">
sudo /usr/sbin/multistrap --arch amd64 \
    -f multistrap.conf \
    -d /var/lib/container-example/example2
</pre>
<br>
Configure stage: (sometimes optional)
<pre class="example">
chroot /var/lib/container-example/example2 \
    dpkg --configure -a
</pre>

???
- Installation does everything it can, up until it needs to run the install
scripts
- Configure is needed for foreign architectures, or more complex native ones
- For clarity, the configure step has been significantly shortened.  See the
example files (or just read the multistrap man page) for more details

# Compare the two tools:

|                                          | debootstrap | multistrap |
|------------------------------------------|:-----------:|:----------:|
| Used by the distro installer             | <p>&#x2714;</p> | |
| Can install from multiple package repos  |             | <p>&#x2714;</p> |
| Has a Config file                        |             | <p>&#x2714;</p> |
| Installs packages with the normal tools  |             | <p>&#x2714;</p> |
| Can install without runing binaries for the target architecture | <p>&#x2714;</p> | &nbsp; |

???
- I use debootstrap for anything simple - especially oneliners
- While debootstrap can be customised to do complex installs, I prefer the
ability to use the multistrap config file
- The config file also allows annotations and git commits to be clear
- It is worth noting that multistrap installs less packages by default

---
# Immediately Useful

- The outputs of these tools can be used as is:

<pre class="example">
chroot /var/lib/container-example/example2
dpkg -l
exit
</pre>

--

## Useful for

- Clean build environments

- Testing the installation of new packages

---
# But not without issues

<pre class="example">
chroot /var/lib/container-example/example1
perl -e 'print "hello world\n"'

--
 
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.

    are supported and installed on your system.

Reading package lists... Done

Need to get 126 kB of archives.
After this operation, 284 kB of additional disk space will be used.

???
- The chroot also has very little isolation from the rest of the system

# Improvements

<div class="exampleref">
    (See the <a href="example3">example3</a> files in the repo for scripts implementing these)
</div>

Building a reusable template:
- fixup

- customise

- minimise

Turning a template into a specific machine:
- instantiate

???
- I separate the post debootstrap changes into several categories, each with
a specific purpose

---
# fixup

These are changes that help the image to boot properly or remove (incorrect)
identifying information - anything that could be considered "broken"

<pre class="example">
rm -f TARGETDIR/etc/hostname
rm -f TARGETDIR/etc/machine-id
rm -f TARGETDIR/etc/ssh/*_key
echo "nameserver 1.1.1.1" > TARGETDIR/etc/resolv.conf
</pre>

???
- however, not "networking", since the image will boot without that and
your network setup is often custom to your environment.

(segway)

---
# customise

The changes needed for your local configuration
- anything that is applicable to all instances of the template.

<pre class="example">
echo root:hunter2 | sudo chpasswd -c SHA256 -R TARGETDIR
</pre>

???
In a non testing environment, this would often be a small list of bootstrap
management users
- which would then be used by your configuration automation tool to login and
perform automated tasks

---
# minimise

Size reductions on the image

<pre class="example">
rm -rf TARGETDIR/usr/share/locale/*
rm -rf TARGETDIR/usr/share/doc/*
rm -rf TARGETDIR/lib/udev/hwdb.bin
</pre>

???
There is often quite a lot of extra space used on these images.  Since the
base images are generally going to be used on automatically created container
systems, there is a lot of documentation that can simply be removed to slim
down the space used.

---
# instantiate

- Some container systems take care of instantiation for you

- If the end result is not a container system, you probably need to do it
yourself.

<pre class="example">
echo realhostname >TARGETDIR/etc/hostname
echo 127.0.1.1 realhostname >>TARGETDIR/etc/hosts
chroot TARGETDIR dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
</pre>

???
- Skip the openssh reconfigure if you dont have ssh installed..

---
# Simple boot

The systemd-nspawn tool provides a quick and no-fuss way to startup and test
containers.

<pre class="example">
sudo systemd-nspawn --boot --ephemeral \
    --directory=/var/lib/container-example/example2
</pre>

`--ephemeral` means that nspawn will copy the template dir and all changes will
be lost when the container stops.

???
- if you dont have the systemd-nspawn, install it from the systemd-container
package.

(This command boots the container with networking shared with the host)

--

- login using the root password you set earlier

- stop the container from inside with a `systemctl poweroff` or from the host
with `machinectl stop NAME`

???
The nspawn command has lots of other options

---
exclude: true

# Use libvirt to run the template with LXC

See the example xml file

virsh define
virsh start

---
# Turn the template dir into a VM disk image

- guestfish

- uefi booting

- packing for qemu

# How do I do this for RPM based distros?

From Debian or Ubuntu, this is a partially working recipe:

<pre class="example">
apt install rpm yum
mkdir -p /var/lib/container-example/centos
mkdir -p /var/lib/container-example/centos/var/lib/rpm
rpm --rebuilddb \
    --root=/var/lib/container-example/centos
wget http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/Packages/centos-release-7-6.1810.2.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm
rpm -i --root=/var/lib/container-example/centos \
    --nodeps \
    centos-release-7-6.1810.2.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm
yum --installroot=/var/lib/container-example/centos \
    install -y rpm-build yum --nogpgcheck
</pre>
